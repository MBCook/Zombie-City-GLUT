This is Zombie City. The original was written by Kevan Davis, and a 3D version for Windows was written by Alan Gordon. This program is mostly functional. There are some limitations (for example, there is no full screen mode). It should (theoretically) work anywhere you have GLUT (Win, Lin, Mac, etc), but I have only tested it on Mac OS X (10.3.8 or so). It was compiled under X-Code 1.5, using GCC 3.3. I make no guarantees that it works, doesn't kill your computer, etc.

The original source didn't come with a license. So the license for this is as follows. I have no responsibility for it in any form should it hurt your computer, it is AT YOUR OWN RISK. You are free to fix bugs, update it, turn it into screen saver, whatever you want to do. All I ask is that if you do something with it, just e-mail me and tell me so I know. You can redistribute this but you must include this file and not change the copyright in the source.
